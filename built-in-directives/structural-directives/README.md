Structural directives are responsible for HTML layout. 
They shape or reshape the DOM's structure, typically by 
adding, removing, and manipulating the host elements to which they are attached.

common structural directives:
NgIf - conditionally add or remove an element from the DOM
NgSwitch - a set of directives that switch among alternative views
NgForOf - repeat a template for each item in a list

Directives are applied to `elements`.
When a directive is applied to an element, that element is called then `host` element.
