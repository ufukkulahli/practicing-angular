Pass data from parent to child with input binding

HeroChildComponent has two 'input properties' marked with '@Input' decorator.
Meaning that accepts value outside of itself.
Before we learned that passing value is not possible without @Input decorator.

And we learned to use 'aliasing'.
We aliased the 'masterName' with 'master'.
It is master outside, masterName inside component.
